# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This project contains a handwritten digit recognizer. The digit recognition is done by training a machine learning model based on the [MNIST handwritten digit dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The project als contains a graphical user interface for drawing digits, which can subsequently predict the drawn digit based on the trained machine learning model.

For the machine learning part, the well known libraries TensorFlow, Keras and Numpy were used. The graphical user interface was developed with the [Tkinter library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html), together with the image processing library [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
